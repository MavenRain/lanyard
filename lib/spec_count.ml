(** The R0 counts (R-Q2), printed by [kanon spec-count] and pinned in the
    "## R0 counts" block of SPEC.md.  dev/r0-count.sh diffs the two, so a
    count that grows past the spec fails the R0-COUNT gate leg.

    Every printed number is [List.length] of the list printed after it.  A
    literal integer in a printed count is a finding.  The shape lists come
    from [Shape] and the former and schema lists from [Term], so a sixth
    shape or a third former moves its own count with no edit here.

    Stage B: every list below is derived.  A shape is admitted when
    [Rules.rules] gives it a pack, and an eta row exists when the pack
    says so, so a pack that gains or loses a row moves its own count with
    no edit here.  The row names are built by concatenation from
    [Term.formers] and the names [Rules.admitted] reports, both because
    the names are then derived and because a shape name written out in
    this file would fail the R0-AUDIT gate leg. *)
