# M0 build log

## Stage 0 (2026-09-05)

### Deliverables

- /Users/oobi/Documents/kanon: a new git repository, `git init -b main`, branch main, zero commits, only `dev/` created.  Nothing was committed at any point.
- /Users/oobi/Documents/kanon/dev/bench.sh: the millisecond timer, mode 755.  It takes NAME and CMD, runs CMD once untimed as a warm-up, then RUNS timed runs (RUNS from the environment, default 5).  Each timed run is `/bin/zsh -f -c CMD` under `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3 -P` with `time.perf_counter_ns()` around `subprocess.run`, stdin, stdout and stderr on /dev/null, so interpreter start-up stays outside the measurement.  Success prints one line, `BENCH NAME median_ms=... min_ms=... max_ms=... runs=N`, three decimals.  A non-zero child exit prints `BENCH-ERROR NAME exit=N` and exits 1.
- /Users/oobi/Documents/kanon/dev/pin-dune.sh: the dune runner, mode 755.  It puts /Users/oobi/.opam/zxcaml-p1/bin first on PATH, clears the user chpwd hooks, cds into /Users/oobi/Documents/kan-lang-tot-pin and execs dune with the given arguments.  Every dune call at Stage 0 went through it.
- /Users/oobi/Documents/kanon/dev/denominators.json: the frozen speed denominators, all fields of brief section 3.4.
- /Users/oobi/Documents/kanon/dev/DENOMINATORS.sha256: `shasum -a 256 denominators.json` written from inside dev/, so the entry is the bare file name.
- /Users/oobi/Documents/kanon/dev/M0-BUILD-LOG.md and /Users/oobi/Documents/kanon/dev/MUTATION-LOG.md: these two judge logs.
- Stage 0a was already done: wasmtime 48.0.1 at /opt/homebrew/bin/wasmtime.  Stage 0d was not in scope.  No kernel code was written.

### Gates

Every gate below was rerun by the judge on 2026-09-05 from one runner script; the evidence is the printed line of that rerun, not the builder's line.

### Frozen numbers

- tot_corpus: 19 files (lib/*.ml plus lib/*.mli of the pin), 4969 lines, sha256 34a46d4c5d338a8cdbfc31c21d98e4e90e128d099a20fac258408ba6a9d1ef86.  The judge recomputed the file list, the line count and the hash from the pin; all three matched the stored values.
- tot_suite_kernel_warm_ms: median 103.662, min 97.081, max 112.818, runs 5.
- ocamlopt_ms_per_kloc: value 1641.599, median_ms 8157.104, min_ms 5949.238, max_ms 14355.273, runs 5, lines 4969.

### Findings and how each was resolved

1. Brief section 2 says lib/ holds 18 .ml files and 2 .mli files.  The pin holds 17 .ml files and 2 .mli files, 19 files together.  The line count in the brief is right: `wc -l` over the sorted list prints `4969 total`.  Resolved by listing the corpus as measured, 19 files, and keeping lines at 4969.  The judge recounted from the pin and printed `n=19` and `recounted=4969`.
2. The first bench build put S0-G1 at `median_ms=19.157` against a 20 ms bar, because `zsh -c` reads the user .zshenv on every child.  Resolved by timing `/bin/zsh -f -c CMD`, which reads no rc file.  S0-G1 then printed 12.415 ms.  This is a disclosed deviation from the literal `zsh -c CMD` of brief section 3.2; the one-string contract of CMD is unchanged, and every gate and both mutants were rerun against the shipped script.
3. S0-G1 sits close to its bar under load.  The judge's first rerun printed `median_ms=19.265` with `max_ms=49.839`, and three later reruns printed medians 13.218, 12.426 and 11.973; a RUNS=9 probe printed 15.905.  Every median stayed under 20, so the gate passes on the first honest attempt, but the margin is the thinnest of the seven gates and a loaded host can push one run high.  Recorded, not worked around.
4. The user .zshenv installs the chpwd hook `_telcoin_shared_target`, which reads $CARGO_TARGET_DIR unguarded.  Under `set -u` the hook aborts the shell, so the runner printed `_telcoin_shared_target:7: CARGO_TARGET_DIR: parameter not set` and exited 1 with no dune output, and the first runner_overhead bench printed `BENCH-ERROR runner_overhead exit=1`.  Resolved by clearing `chpwd_functions` and any `chpwd` function in pin-dune.sh before the cd.  The runner then printed `3.24.2`.
5. The build timings are noisy on this host: serial min 5949.238 against max 14355.273, a ratio near 2.4, and parallel min 2136.219 against max 6056.087.  The median is the frozen figure and min and max are stored beside it, so later stages can see the spread.
6. Per brief section 3.4 the timed unit for ocamlopt_ms_per_kloc is `dune clean` followed by `dune build -j 1 ./lib`, so the clean is inside the measured interval.  The exact string is stored in the `command` field and named in `method`, so the denominator is reproducible.

### Decisions taken during the build

- The child shell is `/bin/zsh -f -c` rather than `zsh -c`: same one-string contract, no user rc files, honest timing.
- pin-dune.sh clears the user chpwd hooks before the cd; no hook runs inside a timed call.
- RUNS stayed at the default 5 for every frozen measurement, because a `RUNS=` prefix on an agent Bash call is banned.  The judge's RUNS=9 run was a stability probe only; no frozen number came from it.
- main.exe was timed from /Users/oobi/Documents/kan-lang-tot-pin/_build/default/test, the first cwd tried; it exited 0 there and also from the pin root.
- Corpus paths are relative to the pin root, sorted by `sort`, and the sha256 is the hash of `cat` over that order.
- After the measurements a full `zsh /Users/oobi/Documents/kanon/dev/pin-dune.sh build` restored main.exe; the pin stayed at 8cf0b8b with porcelain 0, and no pin source was touched.
- Nothing was committed.  Every file lives under /Users/oobi/Documents/kanon/dev/.

## Stage A (2026-09-05)

Skeleton and term.  Two builders on one tree, a verifier, a fixer and a judge.  The judge reran every gate of the brief section 4 and every mutation of section 5 itself.  Nothing was committed;  the repository still holds one commit, 5181bbd.

### Deliverables

- Root: dune-project `(lang dune 3.24)` `(name kanon)`, a root `dune` with `(data_only_dirs vendor)` and `(env (_ (flags (:standard -warn-error +a))))`, PIN holding `8cf0b8b`, .gitignore, LICENSE-MIT, LICENSE-APACHE, README.md and SPEC.md.
- Submodule vendor/tot at 8cf0b8b, added with `-c protocol.file.allow=always` from /Users/oobi/Documents/tot.  .gitmodules records `url = /Users/oobi/Documents/tot`.
- Runners dev/dune.sh and dev/dunecho.sh, both mode 755, both resolving the root from `${0:A:h}/..` so a copy checks itself (SA-D7).
- lib/, library kanon_kernel: shape.ml (the five-constructor sum, polymorphic in the term), term.ml (plan section 4, thirteen constructors, `formers` and `schema`), eterm.ml (the erased IR as types only, D-M0-2), error.ml, pp.ml, spec_count.ml, and the seven carried files level.ml, level.mli, quantity.ml, literal.ml, global.ml, budget.ml, budget.mli.
- dev/CARRIED.md and dev/carry-check.sh, seven rows.
- bin/kanon.ml: `spec-count` prints the R0 block and exits 0;  `check`, `emit`, `run` and `axioms` name Stage E and exit 64;  any other word prints one usage line and exits 64.
- SPEC.md with the claim, the closed grammar, the "## R0 counts" block, the eta table, the named rules ledger, the framework axiom, the sugar table, the encoder subset and the surface grammar.
- dev/r0-count.sh, which diffs the SPEC.md fence against `kanon spec-count`.
- surface/, library kanon_surface: token.ml, lexer.ml, syntax.ml with the printer (SA-D2), parser.ml.
- test/main.ml, test/dune and ten fixtures a01 to a10.

### Gates

| id | result | evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SA-G1 BUILD | pass | `zsh dev/dune.sh clean` exit 0, then `zsh dev/dunecho.sh build` printed `OK build: 0 errors, 0 warnings`, exit 0. |

| SA-G5 R0-AUDIT | pass | `rg -n 'SPi|SColl|SPar|SMu|SNu' lib --glob '!shape.ml' --glob '!pp.ml'` printed nothing, exit 1. |
| SA-G6 PIN | pass | PIN, `git -C vendor/tot rev-parse --short HEAD` and `git -C /Users/oobi/Documents/kan-lang-tot-pin rev-parse --short HEAD` all printed 8cf0b8b;  the pin worktree porcelain count is 0;  `git -C /Users/oobi/Documents/tot status --porcelain | wc -l` printed 11 at every check. |
| SA-G7 REPO | pass | `git rev-list --count HEAD` printed 1 at 5181bbd on main;  the porcelain holds 19 lines, `A  .gitmodules`, `A  vendor/tot` and 17 untracked paths, none under _build and none under .gatework;  `rg -n 'url = ' .gitmodules` printed `url = /Users/oobi/Documents/tot`. |
| SA-G8 HOUSE | pass | `rg -n 'raise |failwith|assert |exception |\| _ ->|List\.nth|\.\('` over lib, surface, bin and test with the .ml and .mli globs printed nothing, exit 1;  a separate sweep for `\| true`, `\| false`, `true ->` and `false ->` printed nothing, exit 1, and a reading of the pair matches in quantity.ml and literal.ml confirms they scrutinise a pair of quantities and a pair of literals, not a bool. |

### Decisions carried from the brief

- SA-D1 application by juxtaposition is a surface production and a sugar row, Out at Ran SPi, address APt.
- SA-D2 surface/syntax.ml holds the surface AST and the printer;  token.ml rides with the lexer as in tot.
- SA-D3 the surface word `auto` builds the Auto constructor;  `mu` and `nu` are reserved and refused with their milestone names.
- SA-D4 bin/kanon.ml exists from Stage A with spec-count only;  the other four commands name Stage E and exit 64.
- SA-D5 shape.ml is polymorphic in the term, so term.ml carries no shape name and R0-AUDIT runs from Stage A.
- SA-D6 warnings are errors through the root dune env stanza;  vendor is data-only for dune.
- SA-D7 the runners and the check scripts resolve the repo root from their own path, so the mutation copies check themselves.

### Decisions taken during the build

- SA-D8 quantity.ml is carried verbatim with tot's two marks Zero and Many.  Plan section 1 spells three stamps, zero, one and omega.  The third mark would make the file a rewrite rather than a carry and changes no Stage A gate, so it lands at Stage B and the carry stays at delta 2.
- SA-D9 literal.ml is carried verbatim, so Nat is an OCaml int at Stage A.  D-M0-1 wants arbitrary precision;  that widening lands at Stage B with the prims, because nothing at Stage A evaluates a literal.
- SA-D10 error.ml gains `message : t -> string` beside `to_string`, because mutation SA-M1 requires the bare producer text without the position prefix.  The brief asks for at least the three constructors and to_string, so this is an addition.
- SA-D11 spec_count.ml derives the eta row names by concatenation from Term.formers and Shape.admitted rather than writing them out.  A literal row list would spell a shape name and fail SA-G5.
- SA-D12 SPEC.md marks SPar as M1, refused by rules.ml.  The plan puts SPar out of M0 and names no milestone;  brief 3.7 requires a mark, so SPar reads at M1 beside SMu.  A later ruling moves it with a one-row edit.
- SA-D13 the last arm of the driver's command dispatch binds `_unknown`, not a wildcard.  A match on a string cannot be exhaustive, and the named binder does not trip the SA-G8 sweep.
- SA-D14 dev/carry-check.sh and dev/r0-count.sh keep their work files in ROOT/.gatework, which .gitignore lists, because `mktemp -d` fails with "Operation not permitted" under the agent sandbox and a work path inside the tree lets a mutation copy run with no writable path outside itself (SA-D7).  Both scripts remove the directory before and after each run, so it never appears in git status;  the judge confirmed that `git status --porcelain | rg '.gatework'` prints nothing.
- SA-D15 dev/CARRIED.md carries a markdown separator row, and carry-check.sh reads only rows that begin `| lib/`, so neither the header nor the separator reads as a carried file.
- SA-D16 one projection node.  syntax.ml has `SProj of t * int` for `.1`, `.2` and `.k`.  The lexer keeps Dot1, Dot2 and Dot as separate tokens and reads a dot with a digit run, so `.10` is leg ten and never leg one and then zero.
- SA-D17 binder marks.  SPEC.md section 9 spells the alphabet `'0' | '1'` while the carried Quantity.t holds Zero and Many (SA-D8).  `'0'` reads Zero, `'1'` reads Many and an absent mark reads Many.  The printer writes Zero as `0 ` and Many as no mark, so the round trip is stable.  When the third mark lands at Stage B, `'1'` takes its own reading and `w` spells Many.
- SA-D18 one surface error type.  lexer.ml returns Error.Parse rather than a second surface error sum in tot's Serror shape, because brief 3.9 asks parse for `(decl list, Error.t) result`.
- SA-D19 one catch site in test/main.ml.  `In_channel.input_all` and `Sys.readdir` are the only stdlib calls in the suite that can fail, and the OCaml 5.2 standard library offers no total form of either.  See the findings below.
- SA-D20 the two item lists compare with the structural equality of the standard library.  Both are first-order values of strings, integers, quantities and constructors, with no functional value and no cycle, so the comparison is total.
- SA-D21 a branch body and a motive body print at application level, so a case, a fun, a let, an arrow or a star in that position takes parentheses.  The M0 grammar has no `end` terminator, unlike tot, so without this rule a nested case would take the bar of the branch that follows it.
- SA-D22 `inj k of n t` and `absurd t` each read one application, not one atom and not one whole term.  An atom would refuse `absurd f x` and a whole term would swallow a following arrow.
- SA-D23 the empty collection has two spellings, `()` and `tuple ()`, and they are two different nodes, SUnit and STuple [].  The lexer reads `()` as one token, and the tuple parser accepts that token as the empty list.

### Findings

- F1 exception use in the test driver, medium, resolved as far as the brief allows.  The verifier found that test/main.ml turned two stdlib failures into results with two separate `try ... with Sys_error` sites, which brief section 3.10 ("No exception anywhere") reads against, and that gate SA-G8 cannot see the construct because its pattern list holds `raise `, `failwith`, `assert `, `exception `, the wildcard arm, `List.nth` and the unsafe index, and never the word `try`.  The fixer merged the two sites into one named boundary function, `let attempt_sys (thunk : unit -> 'a) : ('a, string) result = try Ok (thunk ()) with Sys_error m -> Error m`, at test/main.ml:40, and gave it a doc comment that names SA-D19, the two calls it wraps and the blind spot of the gate.  The judge confirmed the count: `rg -n '\btry\b' lib surface bin test --glob '*.ml' --glob '*.mli'` prints three lines, main.ml:24 and main.ml:36 in the comment and main.ml:40 in the code, and no other file in the repository holds the word.  The fixer also showed, on a scratch copy with the catch removed, that the copy aborts with `Fatal error: exception Sys_error(...)` and exit 2 on a missing directory and on an unreadable fixture, where the shipped tree prints a FAIL line and `PARSE-FAIL`, exit 1.  So the last catch is what makes the second clause of section 3.10 hold.  The judge accepts the one disclosed site and rules that Stage B extends the SA-G8 pattern list with `\btry\b` and pins the allowed count at one, in test/main.ml only.
- No other finding.  The reading of the delivered .ml and .mli files against plan section 11 found no raise, no failwith, no assert, no wildcard arm, no bool match and no partial indexing;  spec_count.ml prints every count through `List.length` in one `Printf.sprintf "%s %d: %s\n"` helper, with no literal integer in a printed count.

### Hand-off notes for Stage B

- spec_count.ml holds two lists that Stage B must derive from Rules rather than declare: the named rules ledger (three declared, two present) and the eta table.  The file carries the comment that says so.  When rules.ml lands, `admitted` and the eta rows come from it and the R0 block stays byte for byte the same, which dev/r0-count.sh proves.
- global.ml is carried at delta 126, the largest carry, because Stage A drops every entry that refers to a module which arrives at Stage B.  Stage B adapts it again and updates the row in dev/CARRIED.md;  the delta line at the top of the file records the drop.
- quantity.ml gains the third mark (SA-D8) and literal.ml widens Nat to arbitrary precision (SA-D9, D-M0-1).  Both are carry rows, so both deltas change and dev/CARRIED.md changes with them.
- surface/elab.ml arrives at Stage B and reads syntax.ml into Term.t.  SA-D16 leaves the two sugar rows of the projection to the elaborator, which knows the type of the scrutinee;  the parser cannot tell them apart.
- The Auto node parses at Stage A and the checker refuses it at Stage B with "instances arrive at M2".  mu and nu never reach the AST, since the parser refuses them (SA-D3).
- SPEC.md marks SPar at M1 (SA-D12).  If a later ruling moves it, the row and the milestone column change together.
- Gate SA-G8 gains `\btry\b` at Stage B, with the one allowed site in test/main.ml (F1).


## Stage B (2026-09-05)

Kernel and checker, brief sections 3.1 to 3.7.  The kernel half of Stage B:  the carried adaptations, the rule pack, the values and the evaluator, typed conversion, the checker with the primitives, the derived R0 counts and the kernel half of SPEC.md.  Nothing was committed and the index was never touched;  the repository holds two commits and a clean index.

### Deliverables

- lib/quantity.ml gains the third mark, `type t = Zero | One | Many`, with `mul` absorbing at Zero, `One` the unit and `Many` otherwise, `equal` and `to_string` writing "0", "1" and "w" (SB-D3).  The carry delta rises from 2 to 34.
- lib/literal.ml stays as carried at delta 2 (SB-D4).  level.ml and level.mli stay as carried;  `imax` lives in rules.ml (SB-D6).
- lib/global.ml is re-adapted:  `Prim of prim_entry` beside Def and Axiom, `prim_of`, `find_prim` and `initial`, which holds Nat as an axiom at `Univ one` and the five primitives at their closed types.  The carry delta rises from 126 to 164 and dev/CARRIED.md records both new numbers with the reason.
- lib/error.ml gains the checker arms, among them `Cannot_infer`, `Quantity`, `Overflow` and `Budget_exhausted`, each with its producer text.
- lib/rules.ml, the single dispatch point:  `map_shape`, the abstract `'c ops` record, `rule_pack` with sixteen fields, `spi_pack`, `coll_pack`, `rules`, `imax` at the SB-M3 site, `arrow`, `bool_ty`, `bool_value`, the total index `at` and the total pair view `two_of`.  Only shape.ml, pp.ml and rules.ml spell a shape name in lib/.
- lib/value.ml:  VUniv, VLan, VRan, VIn, VSec, VLit and VNeutral with the head and the spine, the closures, the addresses and the total views, `as_ctor` among them.
- lib/eval.ml:  `eval` over the thirteen term constructors, the evaluator record `ev`, the literal fast path `prim_step` with `whnf` as that path alone, and `quote` with `quote_former`, `quote_leg`, `quote_addr` and `quote_neutral`.
- lib/conv.ml:  `conv` in the three steps of plan section 5, proof irrelevance at the SB-M2 site, eta by the type through the pack rows with the SB-M1 site on `expand_ran` of the point pack, then structural comparison with the spine walked at the type the head's type assigns.
- lib/check.ml:  the context with the locals, the globals and the budget, `infer` and `check` as one recursive knot with the `ops` record, the declaration checker with `Definition` and `Postulate`, and the entry points `infer_term`, `check_term` and `check_decls`, each with `?budget`.
- lib/prim.ml:  the five nat primitives with their arity, their closed types, truncated subtraction, guarded addition and multiplication, `reduce` for the literal answers and `apply` for the literal and the collection answers together.
- lib/shape.ml loses `admitted`, and lib/spec_count.ml reads `Rules.admitted`, `Rules.eta_table`, `Rules.named_declared` and `Rules.named_present`.  Every printed number stays a `List.length` and the eight lines do not change.
- SPEC.md:  the 2.2 Univ row (SB-D2), a new "### 4.1 The rule pack, lib/rules.ml" listing the sixteen fields as built with the `expected` argument of SB-D6, the One line in section 5, the imax block in section 6 naming the SB-M3 site, and a new "## 10 Obligations at M0" with four rows.

SB-G4 SUITE-KERNEL and SB-G10 AXIOMS read the surface half and the fixtures, which are the other builder's deliverables, so this half does not report them.

### Decisions carried from the brief

- SB-D1 sum and prod are sugar rows over Lan (SColl n) and Ran (SColl n), not formers;  the empty ones default to Prop and take Type 0 through an Ann (D-M0-6).
- SB-D2 Prop is `Univ zero`, `Type n` is `Univ (n + 1)`, `Univ l` infers `Univ (succ l)`, no cumulativity;  the Stage A SPEC row is corrected.
- SB-D3 quantity.ml gains One, the surface mark '1' reads it, the checker counts One as Many at M0, and the linear counter is an M1 obligation in SPEC.md section 10.
- SB-D4 Nat stays an OCaml int:  natAdd and natMul answer `Error Overflow` instead of a wrong value and natSub truncates at zero, so the range half of D-M0-1 waits for a bignum the user pins.
- SB-D5 check and axioms land at Stage B;  emit names Stage D and run names Stage E;  `check --print` is the golden generator.
- SB-D6 `form_lan` and `form_ran` take `expected:Level.t option`, so SColl 0 takes its universe from an Ann;  `imax` lives in rules.ml, not in the carried level.ml.
- SB-D7 the SColl 0 universe survives evaluation, and two SColl 0 formers at different universes are never convertible.
- SB-D8 Nat is a primitive type constant of `Global.initial`;  Bool is not primitive, since natEq and natLt answer the two leg sum of the unit type;  the three arithmetic primitives have type `Nat -> Nat -> Nat`.
- SB-D9 the SMu negative is built in OCaml inside test/main.ml;  Auto is a surface negative.
- SB-D10 a negative compares `Error.message` exactly with its sidecar line.
- SB-D11 no agent touches the git index;  the closer prints the commit blocks.
- SB-D12 conv and check share the function record of rules.ml;  lib/ holds no cell of state, no field that changes, no Array and no Hashtbl.
- SB-D13 the four mutation sites carry a `(* SB-Mk site *)` comment line.
- SB-D14 `.1` and `.2` are the pair projections on a Lan SPi scrutinee and `.k` is the 0-based leg on a Ran (SColl n) scrutinee.
- SB-D15 the runner's argument is the test root;  the Stage A mutation command is history.

### Decisions taken during the build

- SB-D16 the checker context stays abstract behind a `'c ops` record declared in rules.ml, so rules.ml never names check.ml and the knot needs no cell of state (SB-D12).  check.ml builds the one instance of the record.
- SB-D17 `infer` answers the type as a value and `check` answers unit.  No arm restamps a term, so the checker never rewrites what it reads and the surface keeps the only elaboration step.
- SB-D18 the pack carries both halves of eta:  the descriptive row that spec_count reads and the two expansion functions that conv applies.  One table then feeds the count and the rule, so the printed R0 block cannot drift from the behaviour.
- SB-D19 error.ml gains `Cannot_infer` beside the named arms, because a bidirectional checker refuses In and Sec in inference position and that refusal is not a mismatch.  `Budget_exhausted` carries its text so the driver prints one line.
- SB-D20 an axiom is usable at any mode at M0.  A postulate has no body, so no erased read can leak through it, and the quantity of a postulate arrives with the linear counter at M1.
- SB-D21 a string literal has no type at M0:  `Lit (LString _)` answers `Not_yet "string types arrive at M1"`.  literal.ml is carried whole (SB-D4), so the constructor exists with no rule.
- SB-D22 `Prim.reduce` answers None for natEq and natLt, and `Prim.apply` builds their collection answer through `Rules.bool_value`.  The literal fast path then stays a function on literals and the shape name stays inside rules.ml.
- SB-D23 the diagram of a former is a closure:  the point shape opens it by application at the argument and the collection shape opens it by forcing.  `diagram_arity` on the pack tells quote how many binders to open.
- SB-D24 every Stage B definition is `reducible = true`, `rec_arg = None` and `partial = false`.  A definition is added to the globals only after its body checks, so a self reference answers `Error (Unbound name)` and no recursion enters the kernel at M0.
- SB-D25 `ops` gains `o_quote` and `o_head_ty` and the pack gains `diagram_arity` and `spine_ty`, so conv walks a neutral spine at the type the head's type assigns without spelling a shape name.  This keeps the R0-AUDIT gate true of conv.ml.
- SB-D26 a comparison that goes under a binder binds the local at the placeholder type `VUniv Level.zero` when no type is available.  A placeholder can only lose the eta step and fall back to structural comparison, so it weakens conversion and never accepts two different terms.
- SB-D27 the third mark of SB-D3 broke the exhaustive match of `mark` in surface/syntax.ml, the other half's file.  One arm, `| Kanon_kernel.Quantity.One -> "1 "`, was added there, the least edit that keeps the build green and the printer's round trip true.
- SB-D28 the SB-G9 sweep reads text, not only code:  the pattern `List\.nth` also matches `List.nth_opt` and `\bref\b` also matches the word "ref" in a comment.  rules.ml therefore holds a hand rolled total index `at`, and two comments were reworded.
- SB-D29 the SB-D7 carrier is a `Level.t option` slot on VLan and VRan.  The former's level is filled from the Ann when the diagram cannot name it, conversion compares the slot, and quote restores it as `Ann (core, Univ l)`, so the universe survives a round trip through values.

### Findings

- F2 the Stage A hand-off note and SB-D4 disagree, low, resolved by the brief.  The note at the end of the Stage A section says literal.ml widens Nat to arbitrary precision at Stage B (SA-D9, D-M0-1).  SB-D4 keeps the host integer, because zarith is not installed and no agent installs software.  literal.ml therefore stays carried at delta 2, natAdd and natMul answer `Error Overflow` at the boundary so no wrong number is ever produced, and SPEC.md section 10 lists arbitrary precision Nat as an M1 obligation that needs a bignum the user pins.
- F3 blocker SB-B6 fired at the closing check, high, reported and not worked around.  `git -C /Users/oobi/Documents/tot status --porcelain | wc -l` printed 11 at the opening check and 0 at the closing check.  The cause is a user commit, not an agent write:  tot HEAD is now `6bcc1b7 M7 Stage E`, its parent is `8cf0b8b`, and its stat line reads `11 files changed`, the same eleven paths.  The pin worktree stays at 8cf0b8b with an empty porcelain and ROOT/vendor/tot stays at 8cf0b8b, so SB-B2 holds and nothing this half read has moved.
- F4 a mutation site sits in a file the other half owns nothing of, low, no action.  The four `(* SB-Mk site *)` comments are all in lib/, at `expand_ran` of the point pack, at the irrelevance step of conv.ml, at `imax` in rules.ml and at the SMu arm of `rules`, so the verifier finds every site with one rg over lib/.
- No other finding.  A reading of the delivered .ml files against plan section 11 found no exception, no raise, no failwith, no assert, no wildcard arm, no match on true and false, no partial index, no loop keyword and no cell of state;  every Option and Result flows through combinators.

### Hand-off notes for Stage C

- The zero positions the checker marks.  Mode is a `Quantity.t` argument threaded through `infer` and `check`.  Every type position goes through `infer_univ`, which reads its term at mode Zero:  the domain and the diagram of a former, the ascription of an Ann, the type of a Let and a motive.  A local stamped Zero reads at mode Zero and nowhere else, by `readable`, and a runtime read of it answers `Error (Quantity ..)`.  Erasure at Stage C drops exactly the arguments whose binder is stamped Zero, and the checker has already proved that no runtime position reads one.
- The golden directory.  `kanon check --print FILE` is the golden generator (SB-D5) and test/golden/NAME.checked holds one file per positive fixture.  Stage C adds the erased goldens beside them;  the printed kernel form is the input of the erasure comparison, so the two files stay in step by name.
- The SB-D7 carrier.  VLan and VRan hold a `Level.t option` beside the shape and the diagram (SB-D29).  Erasure ignores the slot, since a universe is check time only, but eterm.ml must keep the two SColl 0 formers apart if it ever compares types, because the slot is the only thing that separates them.
- totality.ml's M1 signature.  No recursion exists at M0, so the guard is the invariant of SB-D24:  declarations are checked in order and the name is added to the globals only after the body checks, so a self call cannot resolve.  `Global.def_entry` already carries `rec_arg` and `partial`, which Stage B fills with None and false.  totality.ml at Stage C states the M1 signature over the globals, the declared name, the checked type and the body, answering the guarded argument index or an Error, and answers Ok at M0 by that invariant with no traversal.

### Deliverables, brief sections 3.8 to 3.13

- surface/token.ml and surface/lexer.ml gain the two reserved words of SB-D1, `KSum` and `KProd`, with `describe` writing `'sum'` and `'prod'`.
- surface/syntax.ml gains `SSum of t list` and `SProd of t list` at atom level, printed `sum (A, B)` and `prod (A, B)`, and the binder mark reads and prints the third quantity.
- surface/parser.ml reads the mark `1` as `Quantity.One` (SB-D3), lists the two words among the atom starters, and reads the one bracketed item list through `parse_items`, which three words now share:  `tuple`, `sum` and `prod`.
- surface/elab.ml, new, the whole of brief section 3.9:  bidirectional, no metavariable, de Bruijn resolution against `Check.ctx`, one arm per surface constructor, the two projection views of SB-D14 with the projection motive of D-M0-3, `elab_program` folding the declarations against the globals, and `check_text`, `checked_form` and `axiom_names` for the driver and the suite.
- bin/kanon.ml:  `check FILE`, `check --print FILE`, `axioms FILE`, `emit` and `run` naming Stages D and E at exit 64, and `spec-count` unchanged.  bin/dune links the surface library.
- test/main.ml, rewritten to the four groups of brief section 3.11:  PARSE over fixtures and negatives, CHECK against the goldens, NEG against the `.err` sidecars, KNEG for the shapes M0 declares and does not admit, then `SUITE-KERNEL`.  The one catch site stays `attempt_sys`.
- test/fixtures:  b01-function-eta, b02-sum-prod, b03-case-motive, b04-leg-proj, b05-proof-irrelevance, b06-impredicativity, b07-bool-prims and b08-axiom-disclosure, and the ten Stage A fixtures edited so that every one checks.
- test/golden:  eighteen `.checked` files written by `kanon check --print` and read before they were kept.
- test/neg:  n01-universe, n02-mismatch, n03-unbound, n04-quantity, n05-wrong-leg, n06-auto, n07-missing-branch and n08-not-a-function, each with a one line `.err` holding the `Error.message` text.  Every one fails in the checker and none in the parser.
- SPEC.md:  the two `sum` and `prod` rows of section 7, the corrected `Type n` row, the two projection rows, the SB-D1 and SB-D3 blocks, and the two productions and the mark reading in section 9.  README.md gains the "Checking a file" paragraph.

### Decisions taken during the build, sections 3.8 to 3.13

- SB-D30 the elaborator emits `Term.Global x` for a name no local binds, without a lookup of its own.  The checker then reports an unknown name as `Unbound`, so a negative fixture for an unbound name fails in the checker and not in a second name table the elaborator would have to keep in step.
- SB-D31 elaboration infers at mark Zero.  Every inference the elaborator needs is the type of a term, which is a check time reading, so no elaboration step spends a runtime read and no fixture fails on a quantity the surface never wrote.
- SB-D32 a branch binder takes its type from the leg of the diagram, never from the type the branch writes.  The surface binder carries a type because the grammar gives it one, and the elaborator reads its name and its mark and drops the annotation, so a wrong annotation cannot widen a branch.
- SB-D33 the driver reads a file behind `Sys.file_exists` and exits 64 when the guard fails.  The whole repository holds one catch site, in test/main.ml, so the driver cannot catch `Sys_error`;  a path that disappears between the guard and the read leaves the process loudly and never as a wrong answer.
- SB-D34 the `auto` atom leaves the positive fixtures and lives in the negatives.  `auto` has no checked form at M0 by design, so a10 cannot both hold it and check;  n06-auto holds it and reads the exact refusal, which is the stronger test.
- SB-D35 a passing PARSE line prints nothing.  Twenty six passing round trips would print twenty six lines that carry no reading, so the group prints a line for a failure alone and then its count, which is the shape gate SB-G4 reads.
- SB-D36 a FAIL line carries its reason after a colon in every group, KNEG included.  A mutation run then reads why a fixture died and not only that it did, and the kill conditions of brief section 5, which read the prefix, are unaffected.
- SB-D37 the empty forms `sum ()` and `prod ()` under an annotation take `Univ one`, which is D-M0-6 read at SB-D2:  the annotation `Type 0` is `Univ 1`, so `(prod () : Type 0)` is exactly `Rules.unit_ty Level.one` and `sum ((prod () : Type 0), (prod () : Type 0))` is exactly `Rules.bool_ty`.  The answer of `natEq` is then a term of a type the surface can spell, which b07-bool-prims reads.

### Findings, sections 3.8 to 3.13

- F5 six Stage A fixtures could not check as written, low, fixed in place as the brief allows.  a02 declared `erasedDomain` at `Type 0` where imax puts it at `Type 1`;  a04, a05 and a06 postulated the sum and the product types that SB-D1 now writes out;  a07 declared `Prop` at `Type 1` where SB-D2 puts it at `Type 0`;  a08 named two definitions `sum` and `prod`, which are reserved words from Stage B, and now names them `total` and `product`;  a10 held the two `auto` definitions of SB-D34.  Every edit is minimal and each fixture still reads the production it was written for.
- F6 the projection motive of D-M0-3 does not convert with the kernel's own eta projections, low, no fixture depends on it.  `Rules.spi_eta_lan` expands a pair with `None` as the motive, and `conv_motive` answers false when one side has a motive and the other does not, so a comparison of a neutral pair against a rebuilt one is refused.  A rebuilt pair against a declared type checks, which b04-leg-proj reads, and the eta row of the R0 table is unaffected;  a Stage C fix belongs in `conv_motive`, which can read a materialized motive against an absent one.
- F7 blocker SB-B6 does not fire in this half's run, informational.  `git -C /Users/oobi/Documents/tot rev-parse --short HEAD` printed `6bcc1b7` and `git -C /Users/oobi/Documents/tot status --porcelain | wc -l` printed 0, which is the brief's condition, and the pin worktree and `vendor/tot` both stayed at `8cf0b8b` with an empty porcelain.

### Fix round after the Stage B review (2026-09-05)

One round, two findings of the review, F1 high and F2 medium.  Nothing outside ROOT was written and no git command touched the index or HEAD.

- F1 the fixture suite carried other scenarios than brief section 3.12 names, high, fixed.  Six required scenarios were absent:  the negatives n03-sec-non-ran and n08-pi-misuse and the positives b02-pair-eta, b03-tuple-eta, b04-unit-eta and b07-nat-fast-path.  Three negatives and four positives held their required numbers under other names, and two header comments were out of step with their file names.  The round restores every required name and scenario:  n01-universe keeps its file and takes the header id `n01`;  n04-quantity, n05-wrong-leg and n07-missing-branch move to n02-quantity, n04-wrong-leg and n05-missing-branch;  n03-sec-non-ran, n07-self-global and n08-pi-misuse are new;  b02-pair-eta, b03-tuple-eta, b04-unit-eta and b07-nat-fast-path are new.  No coverage is dropped:  the four substituted positives move to b09-sum-prod, b10-case-motive, b11-leg-proj and b12-bool-prims and the three substituted negatives move to n09-mismatch, n10-unbound and n11-not-a-function, each with its header id and its golden or its sidecar.  The suite now reads PARSE-OK 33/33, CHECK-OK 22/22, NEG-OK 11/11, KNEG-OK 1/1 and SUITE-KERNEL OK.
- F2 the SB-B6 blocker report of the kernel half is stale, medium, adjudicated and closed.  `git -C /Users/oobi/Documents/tot rev-parse --short HEAD` prints `6bcc1b7` and `git -C /Users/oobi/Documents/tot status --porcelain | wc -l` prints 0 at this round, which is the pass condition of SB-G6 and is the state brief section 2 and brief section 6 both record.  The eleven line form of the blocker was waived after the user's own commit `6bcc1b7`, so SB-B6 is not open, no ruling is needed and SB-G6 passes on every leg.  The earlier F3 entry of this log stays as the history of that half's run.
- F4 the eta rule at the left former of the point shape did not fire against a written pair, high, found by the new b02-pair-eta fixture and fixed in lib/rules.ml.  A projection of a neutral pair freezes on the spine, and two frozen eliminations convert only when their motives convert (conv.ml `conv_motive`, the pin's `conv_stuck_match` at kan-lang-tot-pin/lib/eval.ml:401).  The rule wrote no motive and marked the scrutinee with the mark of the domain, while surface/elab.ml writes the projection motive of D-M0-3 and marks the scrutinee `Many`, so `p` and `(p.1, p.2)` compared as two different neutrals and both directions of the eta row failed.  The fix gives the rule the same motive and the same mark, in the new `proj_motive` of rules.ml.  Conversion is not weakened by it:  no motive is ignored and no comparison is relaxed;  the two sides now freeze into the same shape.
- No other finding.  The three new negatives each fail in the checker and not in the parser, and each sidecar holds the checker's own `Error.message` text (SB-D10).

### Decisions taken during the fix round

- SB-D38 the eta rule at the left former of the point shape writes the projection motive of D-M0-3 and the scrutinee mark `Many`, the same two things surface/elab.ml writes for ".1" and ".2".  A frozen projection of the rule and a frozen projection of the surface are then one stuck elimination, so the eta row holds for a pair a file writes out.  The motive of the first projection is the domain and the motive of the second is the diagram read at the first projection, as elab.ml builds them.
- SB-D39 a scenario that brief section 3.12 does not name keeps its file and moves above the required numbering, at b09 to b12 and at n09 to n11.  The required eight positives and eight negatives take the names and the scenarios the brief names, and the four extra positives and three extra negatives stay in the suite, so the round adds coverage and removes none.
- SB-D40 the sidecar of a new negative holds the text the checker printed, read from `kanon check` before the file was written (SB-D10).  The three texts are "a section needs a right former as its expected type" for n03-sec-non-ran, "bad" for n07-self-global and the two `Out SPi` types of n08-pi-misuse.
- SB-D41 a golden is regenerated only where the fixture is new.  The five .checked files of b02-pair-eta, b03-tuple-eta, b04-unit-eta and b07-nat-fast-path come from `kanon check --print` and were read before they were kept;  the four goldens of the parked positives were renamed with their fixtures and their bytes did not change;  no other golden was written, and CHECK-OK 22/22 with the untouched goldens shows the rules.ml fix moves no checked form.

### Judge rerun of the Stage B gates (2026-09-05)

The judge reran every gate of brief section 4 on the delivered tree, after the fix round, from one script under SCRATCH and with no git command that writes the index or HEAD.  Ten gates of ten pass.

| Gate | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SB-G1 BUILD | pass | `zsh /Users/oobi/Documents/kanon/dev/dune.sh clean` exit 0, then `zsh /Users/oobi/Documents/kanon/dev/dunecho.sh build` printed `OK build: 0 errors, 0 warnings`, exit 0. |

| SB-G7 REPO | pass | `rev-list --count HEAD` printed 2, `log -1 --format=%s` printed `M0 Stage A: skeleton and term`, `diff --cached --name-only` printed nothing, `write-tree` printed `01f2645c6501eeeaa4015ce323e7368d04106224`, and of the 46 porcelain lines none names a path under _build or .gatework. |
| SB-G8 TRUSTED-LINES | pass | the seven kernel files piped to `wc -l` printed 2166, under the cap of 3000. |
| SB-G9 HOUSE | pass | leg a printed nothing, exit 1;  leg b over lib/ printed nothing, exit 1;  leg c printed only `/Users/oobi/Documents/kanon/test/main.ml:44:  try Ok (thunk ()) with Sys_error m -> Error m`;  a `true ->` and `false ->` sweep over the four directories printed nothing, exit 1, so no match on true and false arms is in the tree. |
| SB-G10 AXIOMS | pass | `kanon.exe axioms test/fixtures/b08-axiom-disclosure.kan` printed the one line `Bit`, exit 0;  `kanon check` on that file exited 0 with no output;  `kanon check test/neg/n01-universe.kan` exited 1 with the one stderr line `mismatch: the term has type Type 2 and the expected type is Type 1`. |

The judge also read the fixture set against brief section 3.12.  Every required name and scenario is present:  the eight positives b01-function-eta to b08-axiom-disclosure and the eight negatives n01-universe to n08-pi-misuse, with the substituted scenarios kept above the required numbering as b09 to b12 and n09 to n11.  Every header id agrees with its file name.

## Stage C (2026-09-05)

Stage C is erasure.  Two builders delivered the tree and this section
was written in the fix round that closed finding SC-F1, so every gate
row and every mutation row below is a line the writer printed.

### Deliverables

- `lib/eterm.ml`, 117 lines:  the IR types stay byte for byte and the
  printer of SC-D2 is appended below them, `print_repr`, `print_ktm`
  and `print_decl`, exhaustive over every constructor, so a `KDelay`
  and a `KForce` of M2 print and only `emit` refuses them at Stage D.
- `lib/erase.ml`, 1100 lines:  the type directed erasure, one arm for
  each of the thirteen constructors of `Term.t`, mirroring
  kan-lang-tot-pin/lib/erase.ml arm by arm, with `entry`, `program`
  and `print` in the signature of brief section 3.2.
- `lib/totality.ml`, 139 lines:  `guard`, the M1 entry point, one
  exhaustive traversal that answers `Ok None` at M0 and
  `Error (Not_yet "structural recursion arrives at M1")` on a self
  name.  It is not wired into the check path (SC-D15).
- `bin/kanon.ml`:  `kanon check --erased FILE`, the golden generator,
  and the usage line
  `usage: kanon check [--print|--erased] FILE | axioms FILE | emit | run | spec-count`.
- `SPEC.md`:  the erasure table of section 2.3, the printed form, the
  two sentences of SC-D11 and SC-D12, and the two new obligation rows
  of section 10, "structural recursion certificate" and "the any repr".
- `README.md`:  one paragraph on `check --erased` and the erased
  goldens.
- `test/main.ml`:  the ERASE group after CHECK and the `KNEG self` row
  after `KNEG smu`, with `attempt_sys` still the one `try` site.
- Five positives, `test/fixtures/c01-prop-argument.kan` to
  `c05-let-erased.kan`, each with `golden/NAME.checked`.
- 27 erased goldens, one beside every checked golden.

### Gates

| Gate | Result | Evidence |

| SC-G10 DRIVER | pass | `kanon.exe check --erased test/fixtures/c02-zero-binder.kan` exit 0 and its diff against `golden/c02-zero-binder.erased` printed nothing;  `check --erased test/neg/n01-universe.kan` exit 1 with the one stderr line `mismatch: the term has type Type 2 and the expected type is Type 1`;  `check --erased` with no path exit 64 with the usage line;  `axioms test/fixtures/b08-axiom-disclosure.kan` printed the one line `Bit`, exit 0;  `check --print test/fixtures/b01-function-eta.kan` diffed empty against `golden/b01-function-eta.checked`. |

Ten gates of ten pass.

### Decisions carried from the brief

- SC-D1 `kanon check --erased FILE` is the erased golden generator, beside `check --print`;  the erased program type and its printer live in erase.ml and eterm.ml, and the IR types of eterm.ml do not change.
- SC-D2 The printed form.  A `KFun` prints as `fun FID (REPR, .., REPR) : REPR := KTM` and a `KRec` as `rec [TID; ..]`, one declaration to a line.  A repr prints as `i31`, `struct TID`, `union TID`, `func TID` or `thunk TID`.  A ktm prints in prefix form with its constructor name, its scalar fields, a subterm in parentheses and a list in square brackets with semicolons.  A `Dropped` entry prints `erased NAME` and a `Postulate` prints `axiom NAME : REPR`.  Names print bare.
- SC-D3 Closure conversion.  A definition whose body is a lambda chain becomes one `KFun (Fid NAME, ..)` of arity n;  any other section at a right point former lifts to `KFun (Fid NAME$k, ..)` and the occurrence is `KClos` with the captures in index order.  An application spine is collected whole.
- SC-D4 Classification asks `Check.infer` and `Eval.whnf`;  erase.ml holds no inference of its own.
- SC-D5 The repr table after weak head normal form:  the prim type Nat is `i31`;  a right point former is `func fn<n>`;  a left point former is `struct pair<R,R>`;  a left collection of width at least one is `union sum<R|..|R>`;  a right collection of width at least one is `struct tuple<R,..,R>`;  the two width zero formers are erased at every position.
- SC-D6 A runtime value whose type is a neutral or any other form outside SC-D5 takes `union any`, and Stage D resolves `any` to eqref.
- SC-D7 A Prop valued definition and a type valued definition are `Dropped`;  an axiom with a runtime type is `Postulate`;  an axiom at a universe or at a proposition is `Dropped`.
- SC-D8 A literal prints through `Literal.t`.  `LString` cannot reach erasure at M0 and the printer still covers it.
- SC-D9 Erasure never evaluates a runtime term;  a primitive application stays a `KApp` of a `KGlobal`.
- SC-D10 A pair elimination binds the scrutinee once with `KLet` and projects under it;  a collection elimination is one `KCase` with the legs in leg order.
- SC-D11 An erased field leaves the struct, the tag and the tid, `KProj` indices are renumbered over the runtime fields, and a struct with no runtime field is `KErased`.
- SC-D12 `KVar` counts runtime binders alone;  the erasure environment maps each kernel binder to a runtime index or to erased, and a use of an erased binder is `KErased`.
- SC-D13 No agent touches the git index;  the closer prints one commit block.
- SC-D14 A tail position is the body of a `KFun`, the body of a `KLet` in a tail position and every branch of a `KCase` in a tail position;  a `KApp` there prints as `KTail`.
- SC-D15 `Totality.guard` traverses at M0, answers `Not_yet` on a self name, is not wired into the check path at M0 and is exercised by `KNEG self`.

### Decisions taken during the build

The two builders took these decisions.  The texts are their own, kept
as they returned them.

- SC-D16 No checker edit was needed for SC-D4.  check.ml carries no .mli, so ctx, make, bind, define, infer, infer_univ and ops are already public and erase.ml reads the checker through them alone.
- SC-D17 eterm.ml is not a carried file (dev/CARRIED.md holds seven rows and none is eterm.ml), so the printer is appended below the types kept byte for byte and the CARRY gate keeps its counts.
- SC-D18 A Prim row erases to Dropped, because the runtime owns the primitive body.  A KApp may name the prim global, and Stage D maps that name to an i32 op.
- SC-D19 An Axiom row at a runtime type erases to Postulate of its repr, and to Dropped at a type or at a proof type.
- SC-D20 The two width zero formers are erased at every position, so a binder at one of them is dropped exactly as a Zero binder is.  width_zero sits in runtime_ty beside the universe test and the proof test.
- SC-D21 Classification infers at quantity mode Many, because erasure reads a term as a runtime use.  A Zero binder read at a runtime position is the checker's Quantity error and never a silent keep.
- SC-D22 A codomain is opened at a fresh variable and never at the argument, so erasure never evaluates a runtime term (SC-D9).
- SC-D23 The walk is bidirectional.  Check.infer answers Cannot_infer for In and for Sec, so the expected type travels down from the parent and inference runs only where no parent said what the position holds.
- SC-D24 The pair elimination names its synthetic scrutinee binder scrut.  The binder holds an SExtra slot, which counts as a runtime binder for the index arithmetic and which no kernel index names.
- SC-D25 The lifted parameter list is the runtime captures, outermost first, and then the runtime points of the chain.  A capture reads its type through Check.infer on Term.Var, so erase.ml does not depend on the shape of the ctx locals record.
- SC-D26 The application spine is collected through a total view.  The view answers None at every node that is not an Out at a point shape with a point address, so the walk never recurses on itself, and an Out at a point shape with a leg address is an honest Mismatch instead of a loop.
- SC-D27 A call whose arguments are all erased is the head alone, and not a KApp with an empty argument list.
- SC-D28 A dropped let defines its value in the checker context only when the value is a type.  A dropped let at a proof binds instead, because evaluating its value would evaluate a runtime term.
- SC-D29 A lifted function is named NAME$N with N counting from 0 in preorder over the declaration, and the lifted functions print before the definition's own function.
- SC-D30 The fibre of a pair reads its type from the codomain when the codomain does not read the point.  A codomain that does read the point holds a variable the fibre's scope has no name for, so the fibre is inferred there instead.
- SC-D31 The lambda chain of a definition lifts into the definition's own fid, so a definition of arity two is one function of two parameters and not a nullary function that answers a closure.
- SC-D32 KClos carries the chain arity, that is the number of parameters the capture list does not supply, so a caller reads the arity it must satisfy.
- SC-D33 Each definition heads its declaration list with KRec of the tids it mentions, deduplicated by printed text in first mention order, so link.ml reads every type before the functions that use it.
- SC-D34 An application whose runtime argument list is empty is the head alone only when the head's erased arity is not zero.  A head of erased arity zero is a nullary function, so its own repr is func fn<0> while the result repr of the call is the result type's repr, and dropping the call would put a closure where a scalar belongs.  The call stays as KApp (h, []) or KTail (h, []).  This is the fix of finding F1 in erase.ml:  the new helper head_arity infers the head's type, whnfs it and reads arity_of, and app_arm keeps the head alone only at arity greater than zero.  The 22 Stage B fixtures print byte for byte the same text before and after the fix.
- SC-D35 c01-prop-argument spells the applied lambda with its type, "((fun (p : P) => 5) : (p : P) -> Nat) a", because a bare section has no type of its own:  the checker answers "cannot infer: a section has no type of its own; it needs an expected type" for the brief's literal spelling (SC-D23).  The annotation is the smallest change that keeps the row the brief asks for, a proof at a Many binder.
- SC-D36 SPEC.md section 9 lists the surface grammar alone and no driver form, so the surface half of 3.8 is README.md alone and SPEC.md takes no edit from builder 2.  The flag already stands in SPEC.md section 2.3, "kanon check --erased FILE prints the erased program", from builder 1.
- SC-D37 The five c fixtures do not repeat the "axiom Nat : Type 0" line that the a fixtures carry, because Global.initial holds the prim type Nat (b07 is the Stage B precedent).  So a Nat position takes the repr i31 of SC-D5 and not the any of SC-D6, which is what c02, c03 and c05 must show.
- SC-D38 c04-case-tags spells its sum as "sum ((prod () : Type 0), Nat)", the Bool spelling of a08, so the payload free leg is the width zero unit former of SC-D20.  Its tag prints "KTag sum<unit|i31> 0 []" with an empty payload list and its branch prints arity 0, which is the row 3.7 asks for.
- SC-D39 The KNEG rows dispatch by name through one kneg function, so the group keeps the shape every other group has, a list of names and a runner from a name.  A name the suite does not know is a FAIL line naming it, not a wildcard arm, so gate SC-G9 stays clean.
- SC-D40 The ERASE group asks Erase.program Global.initial rows and compares Erase.print of the answer, the same two calls the driver makes, so the suite and the golden generator can never drift.  An erasure error is a FAIL line carrying Error.to_string, not an exit.

### Findings and how each was resolved

- F1, during the build.  `app_arm` answered the head alone for every
  call whose runtime argument list was empty, so a call of a nullary
  function took the func repr of the head where the result repr
  belonged.  Resolved in erase.ml by the helper `head_arity`:  the head
  stands alone only at an erased arity greater than zero, and a head of
  arity zero keeps `KApp (h, [])` or `KTail (h, [])` (SC-D34).  The 22
  Stage B fixtures print the same erased text before and after the fix.
- SC-F1, raised by the review.  Neither `dev/M0-BUILD-LOG.md` nor
  `dev/MUTATION-LOG.md` held a Stage C section:
  `git status --porcelain -- dev/M0-BUILD-LOG.md dev/MUTATION-LOG.md`
  printed nothing and `rg -n '^## '` over the two files listed Stage 0,
  Stage A and Stage B alone.  The finding is correct.  Resolved by this
  section and by the "## Stage C" section of dev/MUTATION-LOG.md, both
  written after the fix round reran the ten gates and the three
  mutations (SC-D41, SC-D43).

### Decisions taken during the fix round

- SC-D41 The fix round appends and never rewrites.  The Stage 0, Stage A and Stage B sections keep their bytes, and the Stage C section carries the fix round's own gate rerun, because a gate row must name evidence the writer printed.
- SC-D42 The decisions SC-D16 to SC-D40 are the two builders' own texts, recovered from the run journal of the Stage C workflow and kept as they were returned.  The log records the decision that was taken, not a later paraphrase.
- SC-D43 The three mutations were rerun from fresh copies under SCRATCH/stageC/fm1, fm2 and fm3, made with rsync from ROOT and never from the repo itself, so every killed line in dev/MUTATION-LOG.md is a line the fix round printed.
- SC-D44 A mutation is written at the marked site as one guarded answer, `&& false` or `|| true`, so the copy still builds with no unused binding and the mutant changes exactly the answer the check names.
- SC-D45 No golden was regenerated in this round.  ERASE-OK printed 27/27 and both SC-G10 diffs printed nothing on the delivered tree, so every fixture keeps the promise its name makes and an erased golden that was not re-read is not rewritten.
- SC-D46 The state of the user's tot tree is a note and not a gate:  at the fix round it printed HEAD 98e154c with a porcelain count of 2.  No command of this round writes there.

### Hand-off notes for Stage D

- The tid naming.  A tid is the structural text of its type, so link.ml
  dedups by string:  `pair<R,R>` for a left point former, `sum<R|..|R>`
  for a left collection, `tuple<R,..,R>` for a right collection,
  `fn<n>` for a right point former of runtime arity n, `unit` for a
  payload free leg and `i31` for Nat.  Each declaration heads its own
  list with `KRec` of the tids it mentions, deduplicated in first
  mention order (SC-D33), so the emitter reads every type before the
  function that uses it.
- The fid naming.  A definition owns the fid `NAME`, and a lambda
  lifted out of it owns `NAME$N` with N counting lifted lambdas of that
  declaration in preorder from 0 (SC-D29, SC-D31).
- The any repr.  A runtime value whose type is a neutral takes
  `union any`.  Stage D resolves `any` to eqref, and SPEC.md section 10
  holds the obligation.
- The arity classes.  A `KFun` parameter list is the runtime captures,
  outermost first, and then the runtime points of the chain (SC-D25).
  A `KClos` carries the chain arity, the number of parameters the
  capture list does not supply (SC-D32), so Stage D reads a direct call
  when the head arity matches the argument count and a generic apply
  when it does not.  A head of erased arity zero keeps an empty
  argument list (SC-D34).
- The prim globals a `KApp` may name are the five of `Global.initial`,
  `natAdd`, `natSub`, `natMul`, `natEq` and `natLt`;  the prim type
  `Nat` is dropped.  golden/c03-tail-call.erased prints
  `fun g (i31) : i31 := KTail (KGlobal natAdd) [KVar 0; KLit 1]`.
- The empty `KCase` is the unreachable of Stage D.
  golden/a06-unit-absurd.erased prints
  `fun fromEmpty () : union any := KCase (KErased) []`, a case with no
  branch, and the emitter answers unreachable there.
- The `Postulate` entries print `axiom NAME : REPR`, as
  golden/a10-def-axiom.erased shows with `axiom zero : i31` and
  `axiom Eq : func fn<2>`.  A use is a `KGlobal` with no body, so emit
  must refuse a program that reaches one.
- The tail positions.  `KTail` marks a call in the body of a `KFun`, in
  the body of a `KLet` in a tail position and in a branch of a `KCase`
  in a tail position (SC-D14).  golden/c03-tail-call.erased prints the
  outer call of h as `KTail` and its inner call as `KApp`.

## Stage C review fixes (2026-09-05)

The four review reproducers now pass erasure.  Five fixtures, c06 through
c10, cover dependent pair introduction, dependent case motives, runtime
let definitions in types, partial erased application and eta expansion
under captures, lets and case payloads.  The a01 idNat erased golden now
has one runtime parameter, matching its function type.

- A dependent pair fibre receives the codomain instantiated at its point.
- Pair and collection branches receive the motive at their constructor.
- Let definitions remain in the checking environment.  Emission still
  walks the original syntax and retains runtime lets and primitive calls.
  This supersedes the literal no-evaluation wording of SC-D9, SC-D22 and
  SC-D28: semantic evaluation resolves dependent types only, not emitted
  runtime expressions.  It also replaces the inference fallback in SC-D30.
- An empty erased application preserves its head while source parameters
  remain.  A fully applied nullary function still emits an empty call.
  This replaces the head-arity test in SC-D34.
- Definitions and lifted functions complete their whole type chain by eta
  expansion, so aliases obey the same calling convention as lambdas.
  Runtime indices are shifted under the new parameters while preserving
  let and branch payload binders.  This extends SC-D31 to aliases.

Validation on the updated scratch tree: dunecho build reports zero errors
and zero warnings; PARSE-OK 43/43, CHECK-OK 32/32, ERASE-OK 32/32,
NEG-OK 11/11, KNEG-OK 2/2, SUITE-KERNEL OK and R0-COUNT OK.  The four
standalone review regression assertions also pass.  No prior test or
mutation record was removed.

## Stage D (2026-09-05)

Stage D is WasmGC emission.  Two builders delivered the tree, a fixer
closed finding SD-F1, and the judge wrote this section after a rerun of
SD-G1 to SD-G13 on the repository and of SD-M1 to SD-M3 on three fresh
copies.  Every line quoted below is a line the judge printed.

### Deliverables

- `wasm/dune`, 3 lines:  the library kanon_wasm over kanon_kernel.
- `wasm/gc_encode.ml`, 216 lines:  the byte encoder.  LEB128 unsigned
  and signed, value types, the three composite forms, the type,
  function, export, element and code sections, a locals vector, and one
  instruction sum with one arm for each mnemonic of SPEC section 8.  It
  holds no IR knowledge and it is under the 600 line budget.
- `wasm/link.ml`, 830 lines:  one pass from the erased rows to indices.
  It parses the tid grammar, dedups by text, assigns every type index
  and every function index, and holds the repr inference of SD-D20 and
  the total list reader nth_at of SD-D22.
- `wasm/emit.ml`, 739 lines:  `Emit.program`, the emission of plan
  section 7 under the ABI of SD-D2 to SD-D8, and the five refusals.
- `bin/kanon.ml`, 155 lines:  `kanon emit FILE -o OUT.wasm --export NAME`,
  the exit codes 0, 1, 2 and 64, and the new usage line.
- `bin/dune`, 3 lines:  kanon_wasm joins the driver.
- `dev/run-node.mjs`, 53 lines:  the node runner of SD-D10.
- `dev/encoder-subset.sh`, 86 lines:  the ENCODER-SUBSET gate.
- `dev/house.sh`, 82 lines:  the HOUSE gate as a command (SD-D30).
- `test/wasm.ml`, 283 lines:  the emission suite.
- `test/sys_io.ml`, 32 lines:  the one catch site (SD-D26).
- `test/main.ml`, 243 lines:  the kernel suite, now over 42 fixtures.
- `test/dune`, 3 lines:  one tests stanza over main and wasm (SD-D28).
- `SPEC.md`, 445 lines:  section 8, the new 8.1 emission table and the
  resolved any row of section 10.
- `README.md`, 148 lines:  emit, the runner, the suite and the closure
  ABI paragraph.
- Ten fixtures, d01 to d10, and thirty goldens, one `.checked`, one
  `.erased` and one `.wat` for each.

The budget and the file list are stated in kanon-m0/M0-PLAN.md section 11 and not in SPEC section 9, which is the surface grammar (finding SD-F2). |
| SD-G11 HOUSE | pass | five legs, all through `zsh dev/house.sh` (SD-D30).  Legs 1, 4 and 5 printed nothing;  leg 2 printed only the SD-D18 buffer site, `wasm/gc_encode.ml:84` to `:86`;  leg 3 printed exactly one line, `test/sys_io.ml:19:  try Ok (thunk ()) with Sys_error m -> Error m`.  The last leg runs `rg -n --glob '!vendor' --glob '!**/vendor/**' --glob '!_build' --glob '!**/_build/**' -e PATTERN ROOT`, because ripgrep 15.1.0 does not honor the `!vendor/**` form of the brief and read the vendor tree with it, 69 hits, all under vendor/tot (SD-D29, finding SD-F1).  Final lines `HOUSE no-em-dash OK`, `HOUSE OK`, exit 0. |
| SD-G12 DRIVER | pass | nine legs.  emit d01 with `--export main` exit 0 and wasm-opt read the file, exit 0;  `--export nosuch` printed `kanon: emit: unbound: no definition named nosuch`, exit 2;  a10 with `--export start` printed `kanon: emit: unbound: axiom zero has no body`, exit 2;  a01 with `--export twice` printed `kanon: emit: mismatch: twice is not a Nat definition of arity 0`, exit 2;  `emit` alone printed the usage line, exit 64;  n01 printed `mismatch: the term has type Type 2 and the expected type is Type 1`, exit 1;  `run` printed `kanon: run arrives at Stage E`, exit 64;  `check --erased test/fixtures/c02-zero-binder.kan` diffed empty against its golden;  `axioms test/fixtures/b08-axiom-disclosure.kan` printed one line, `Bit`. |
| SD-G13 HOSTS | pass | ten pairs, node first and wasmtime second:  d01 17 and 17, d02 10 and 10, d03 26 and 26, d04 10 and 10, d05 78 and 78, d06 31 and 31, d07 25 and 25, d08 7 and 7, d09 232 and 232, and d10 a trap on both hosts, node exit 1 with `trap: unreachable` and wasmtime exit 134 with `wasm trap: wasm 'unreachable' instruction executed`.  wasmtime prints one experimental warning on stderr for each of the nine numeric modules (SD-D16). |

Thirteen gates of thirteen pass.

### Decisions carried from the brief

- SD-D1 Function references.  Closures are called through call_ref, so the references row of SPEC section 8 gains `ref.func`, the sections used gain the declarative element segment with flag 3, and the refused list drops element.  Defunctionalization through one dispatch function per arity is noted for the user and is not built.
- SD-D2 Closures.  One struct type `clos` holds an i32 arity, a `(ref func)` code field and a `(ref eq)` env field.  `func fn<n>` maps to `(ref $clos)`.  The code ABI is env first, then n eq parameters, and one eq result.  A prim used as a value gets the same wrapper.
- SD-D3 Two calling conventions.  A KGlobal head at exactly its KFun arity uses the typed signature, with return_call in a tail position and inline i32 code for a prim of two arguments.  A variable head or an arity mismatch uses the closure ABI.
- SD-D4 Generic apply.  `apply<k>` exists for each call site argument count k.  It reads the arity m, calls when m equals k, builds a PAP clos when m is greater, and applies the rest through `apply<k-m>` when m is smaller.
- SD-D5 Sums.  A sum value is `(ref eq)`.  A payload free leg is `ref.i31 k`.  A payload leg of width n is a struct with an i32 tag in field 0.  Dispatch is br_on_cast to i31 and an i32.eq chain, then one br_on_cast for each distinct field shape, then `unreachable`.
- SD-D6 Pairs and tuples.  One struct for each tid with typed fields, KProj is struct.get, `any` and every `union T` map to `(ref eq)`, and `unit` and `tuple<>` have no runtime value.
- SD-D7 Nat boundary.  Nat is i31.  A KLit outside 0 to 1073741823 is an emission error.  natAdd and natMul trap on an answer above the bound, natSub answers 0 below zero, and every comparison is unsigned.
- SD-D8 Export.  `--export NAME` needs a Def NAME at the prim Nat with no parameter.  The export is a separate function that calls NAME and applies i31.get_s.
- SD-D9 A positive fixture joins SUITE-WASM when it defines `main`, and the expected value comes from the kernel, never from a sidecar.  The `.wat` goldens are the print of wasm-opt version 130.
- SD-D10 The node runner is dev/run-node.mjs.  The wasmtime runner is Stage E's.
- SD-D11 ENCODER-SUBSET is dev/encoder-subset.sh, and the numeric row of SPEC section 8 becomes explicit at Stage D.
- SD-D12 Locals.  Every local has its exact repr type and is non nullable.  A let value is set before its body opens a block and a branch payload local is set at the head of its branch, so the non nullable rule holds by construction.
- SD-D13 lib/ is not edited at Stage D unless emission exposes an erasure bug.  No such bug was found, so no kernel file changed and no `.erased` golden moved for that reason.
- SD-D14 One catch site in the repository.
- SD-D15 The emitted module has no import and no table, memory, global, start or data section.  The exports are the one entry.
- SD-D16 wasmtime spelling:  `wasmtime run -C cache=n --invoke NAME FILE.wasm`.  The options stand after `run`, because the sandbox refuses the default cache directory.
- SD-D17 Every composite type is its own rec group, and link.ml dedups by tid text.

### Decisions taken during the build

The two builders and the fixer took these decisions.  The texts are
their own.  The fixer numbered its three decisions SD-D21, SD-D22 and
SD-D23, which the builders had already used, so the judge renumbers the
fixer's three as SD-D29, SD-D30 and SD-D31.  No other text moved.

- SD-D18 gc_encode.ml `byte` is the one Buffer.t site.  The buffer is local, it holds one byte and it is read once, because `Char.chr` is a partial accessor the house rules refuse.
- SD-D19 The array composite form is not encoded at M0, because a constructor no caller builds is an error under `-warn-error +a`.
- SD-D20 Repr inference lives in link.ml, because the type table needs the repr of every capture and every let, so inference and index assignment are one walk.
- SD-D21 An M0 sum leg carries one field or none, so a leg is a bare i31 tag or a struct of the tag and one payload.
- SD-D22 link.ml owns `nth_at`, a total list reader, because the SD-G11 sweep refuses the text `List.nth` and `List.nth_opt` matches it.
- SD-D23 natAdd and natMul trap at the i31 boundary.  The primitive bodies hold a range test, i32.gt_u against 1073741823 then unreachable, and natMul also holds an overflow test, an i32.div_u back check and i32.ne then unreachable, so an answer outside 0 to 1073741823 is a trap and never a wrapped or negative number.  The SPEC section 8 numeric row lists i32.div_u, i32.ne and i32.gt_u, which gc_encode.ml already encoded.
- SD-D24 `drop` in a `.wat` golden is the text printer's rendering of the dead stack value ahead of `unreachable` in the SD-D5 dispatch, not an opcode the encoder emits.  gc_encode.ml has no Drop arm, so `drop` is listed among the non opcode words of dev/encoder-subset.sh and SPEC section 8 says why.
- SD-D25 Every d fixture states the value of main in its first comment line, and the emission suite reads that value from the kernel and not from the comment.  d10 states a value that traps, so the suite expectation for it is a trap and not a number.
- SD-D26 test/sys_io.ml holds the one catch site, `attempt_sys`, with `read_file` and `kan_names`.  test/main.ml aliases both, so two runners under test/ share a single boundary and gate SD-G11 leg 3 still prints exactly one line.
- SD-D27 The emission suite OUTDIR defaults to `_build/wasm-suite` under the root and takes an optional second argument.  Every external tool call runs through `Sys.command` with absolute paths and shell redirection into `NAME.out` and `NAME.err`, so a failure is read from the file and never from an exception.
- SD-D28 test/dune declares one `(tests (names main wasm))` stanza over kanon_kernel, kanon_surface and kanon_wasm, so main.exe and wasm.exe build from one directory and share sys_io.ml.
- SD-D29 Exclusion globs.  ripgrep 15.1.0 on this machine does not honor the `!vendor/**` form, so the em-dash leg of SD-G11 is written with `--glob '!vendor'`, `--glob '!**/vendor/**'`, `--glob '!_build'` and `--glob '!**/_build/**'`, both forms verified.  The basename globs of SD-G7 are honored, so SD-G7 is unaffected.
- SD-D30 HOUSE becomes an executable gate.  dev/house.sh, 82 lines, runs the five legs and prints one verdict line for each, then `HOUSE OK` exit 0 or `HOUSE FAIL` exit 1.  Leg 2 accepts a hit only inside the twelve lines after the `SD-D18.` marker comment, so the disclosed buffer site stays allowed and any other hit fails.  Leg 5 holds the character as an escape, so the file that checks for it does not hold one.  The raw commands stay valid.
- SD-D31 The fixer does not write the logs.  The corrected SD-G11 row text was handed to the judge, who wrote it above.

The builders also returned nine ABI decisions without a number.  The
judge numbers them here, in the order they were returned.

- SD-D32 A KTail becomes return_call or return_call_ref only when the callee result coerces to the caller result with no instruction.  Every other tail call is a plain call and then the coercion.
- SD-D33 KErased emits `ref.i31` of zero, so an erased argument has the eq repr `any` without a null.
- SD-D34 A KApp or a KTail with no argument is the identity on its head.
- SD-D35 A leg struct carries the tag in field 0, so two legs of one payload repr share one struct type and the tag tells them apart.
- SD-D36 The export check runs before link, so `--export` on a name that is not a Nat definition of arity 0 refuses with that message and never reaches the encoder.
- SD-D37 Every KFun of the module is emitted, so a use of an axiom anywhere refuses.  Reachability pruning arrives at Stage E.
- SD-D38 The runtime does not re-check the Nat bound on a literal:  the kernel checks literals and the emitter refuses a KLit outside 0 to 1073741823.
- SD-D39 The SPEC section 8 numeric row names the i32 ops emit.ml emits, while gc_encode.ml keeps three further arms that no emission uses yet.  SD-D23 moved i32.div_u, i32.ne and i32.gt_u from that set into the emitted set.
- SD-D40 The generic helper `apply<k>` answers an eq reference, so an under applied call appends one coercion to the repr link.ml promises the caller.

### Findings

- SD-F1, high, resolved.  SD-G11 HOUSE, run exactly as the brief writes it, did not pass:  the em-dash leg exclusion glob `!vendor/**` is not honored by ripgrep 15.1.0, so the leg read the vendor tree and printed 69 lines, all under vendor/tot, while the builders reported no gate failure.  Stage D's own files hold no such character.  The fixer wrote dev/house.sh with the two honored forms and added the script to the README gate block.  The judge reran it:  the broken form still prints 69 lines, the corrected form prints nothing and exits 1, `zsh dev/house.sh` prints `HOUSE OK` and exits 0, and on a copy with one such character appended to README.md the same script prints `HOUSE no-em-dash FAIL`, the offending line, `HOUSE FAIL` and exits 1.  The leg is not vacuous.
- SD-F2, low, resolved in this log.  The brief attributes the eight kernel file line budget to SPEC section 9.  SPEC section 9 is the surface grammar and holds no file list.  The budget is in kanon-m0/M0-PLAN.md, the gate leg at line 238 and the trusted base of section 11 at line 260.  The SD-G10 row above cites M0-PLAN.md.  The gate itself is unaffected:  2305 lines and 216 lines, both under budget.

### Hand-off notes for Stage E

- The run command.  `kanon run FILE --export NAME` is not built.  Today
  `kanon run` prints `kanon: run arrives at Stage E` and exits 64.  The
  emit path is the model:  the argument order is fixed, a front end
  error exits 1, an emission error prints one `kanon: emit: MESSAGE`
  line and exits 2, and 64 is the usage code.
- The wasmtime spelling is `wasmtime run -C cache=n --invoke NAME
  FILE.wasm` (SD-D16).  The options stand after `run`.  It prints the
  value on stdout and one experimental warning on stderr.  A trap exits
  134 with `wasm trap: wasm 'unreachable' instruction executed`.
- The suite OUTDIR.  `test/wasm.exe ROOT/test [OUTDIR]` defaults OUTDIR
  to `_build/wasm-suite` under the root and creates it when it is
  missing (SD-D27).  Every fixture leaves `NAME.wasm`, `NAME.wat`,
  `NAME.out` and `NAME.err` there, so a Stage E gate can read them.
- examples/m0-spine.kan must exercise every row of the emission table of
  SPEC 8.1:  the five prims with the i31 boundary, a chain of tail
  calls, a pair and a tuple built and projected, a sum with a payload
  free leg and a payload leg cased on every leg, a closure with a
  capture, a partial application over and under the arity, an erased
  polymorphic identity used at Nat, and a nested let with a case inside
  it.  d01 to d10 hold each row once, so the spine is their union with
  one `main`.
- The dev/gates.sh legs of Stage E are the thirteen legs above.  Nine of
  them are already commands:  `dev/dune.sh clean`, `dev/dunecho.sh
  build`, `dev/carry-check.sh`, `dev/r0-count.sh`, `test/main.exe`,
  `test/wasm.exe`, `dev/encoder-subset.sh`, `dev/house.sh` and the git
  reads of SD-G8 and SD-G9.  SD-G7, SD-G10, SD-G12 and SD-G13 are still
  loose commands and want a script each.
- `--host both` exit 3.  Stage E must run each module on node and on
  wasmtime and exit 3 when the two hosts disagree.  The ten pairs of
  SD-G13 are the baseline:  nine equal numbers and one trap on both.
- Two traps to carry.  ripgrep needs its globs before the pattern and
  the pattern behind `-e`;  with `--` first it reads `--glob` as a path
  (SD-G7, SD-D29).  wasm-opt writes `warning: no passes specified, not
  doing any work` on stderr;  it is noise, not an error.

## Stage D review fixes (2026-09-05)

The staged-change review exposed three failures in checked programs:
polymorphic pair projection trapped, generic-call sums lost their case
types, and generic captures disagreed with the wrapper environment type.

- Aggregate fields now store non-null eq references.  Pairs, tuples and
  environments of the same width have equivalent final Wasm types;
  sum payload fields also store eq references.  Every field read casts
  to its checked repr.  Function signatures and locals remain typed.
- KCase now retains the checked scrutinee tid.  Erasure preserves it
  through shifting and tid collection; linking and emission use it for
  dispatch and branch binders.  The erased constructor set is unchanged.
- Link.capture_reprs supplies the lifted capture signature to type
  registration, construction and wrappers.  Capture reads and writes
  use that signature.  This replaces the expression-inferred environment
  layout described in SD-D20.
- Equivalent aggregate types need no cast between them.  Empty cases
  end at unreachable without a dead result cast.  No opcode or gate
  allowlist changed.
- Fixtures d11 to d14 reproduce the review findings.  d15 covers nested
  aggregates, generic input and output layouts, sum payloads, closures
  stored in tuples, and an empty case.  Existing affected erased and WAT
  goldens were regenerated; checked goldens for existing fixtures did
  not change.  SPEC.md and README.md describe the corrected ABI.

Validation on an isolated copy of the index plus these fixes:

| check | result |
| --- | --- |
| dunecho build | 0 errors, 0 warnings |
| kernel suite | PARSE 58/58, CHECK 47/47, ERASE 47/47, NEG 11/11, KNEG 2/2 |
| wasm suite | WASM-OK 15/15; wasm-opt validation, WAT goldens and Node results agree with the kernel |
| Wasmtime regression results | d11 5, d12 1, d13 1, d14 11, d15 36; all exit 0 |
| HOUSE, R0-COUNT, ENCODER-SUBSET | all pass; gate scripts unchanged |
| regression sensitivity | all five added fixtures fail on the original staged backend; see MUTATION-LOG.md |

## Stage E (2026-09-05)

The driver, the spine and the gate battery.  Two builders wrote the code
and the judge reran every gate and every mutation before this entry.

### Deliverables

- bin/host.ml, 137 lines (builder 1).  The three hosts Node, Wasmtime and
  Kernel behind one call, with the outcome sum Value, Trap and Invalid.
- bin/kanon.ml, 296 lines (builder 1).  The fifth command, `kanon run
  FILE --export NAME [--host node|wasmtime|kernel|both]`.
- dev/run-wasmtime.sh, 59 lines (builder 1).  The wasmtime runner with
  the contract of dev/run-node.mjs.
- examples/m0-spine.kan, 348 lines (builder 2).  One `def main : Nat` of
  value 521, no axiom, every other production of SPEC section 9 that the
  M0 front end accepts.
- dev/gates.sh, 350 lines (builder 2).  The fifteen leg battery with
  gate_timed, the MEASURE block and the GATES-OK line.
- dev/r0-audit.sh, 57 lines, and dev/trusted-lines.sh, 70 lines
  (builder 2).  The two new legs of brief 3.5.1.
- README.md, 285 lines (shared).  Builder 1 owns the run paragraph and
  the status lines;  builder 2 added The spine, Gates, two Layout rows
  and three Build and test rows.
- dev/M0-BUILD-LOG.md and dev/MUTATION-LOG.md gain this entry and the
  Stage E mutation section (the judge).

### Gates (the judge reran SE-G1 to SE-G11 on the tree at 2026-09-05 22:01)

- SE-G1 BUILD, OK.  `zsh dev/dune.sh clean` exit 0, then
  `zsh dev/dunecho.sh build` printed `OK build: 0 errors, 0 warnings`,
  exit 0.
- SE-G2 GATES, OK.  `zsh dev/gates.sh` printed fifteen PASS lines, the
  MEASURE block and `GATES-OK`, exit 0.  The final line is `GATES-OK`.
- SE-G3 LEGS, OK.  BUILD, CARRY, R0-COUNT, R0-AUDIT, SUITE-KERNEL,
  SUITE-WASM, ENCODER-SUBSET, AXIOMS, M0-E2E, M0-TIME, M0-RATIO,
  TRUSTED-LINES, DENOMINATORS, HOUSE, PIN, one PASS line each in the
  order of brief 3.5, and no FAIL line in the run.
- SE-G4 DRIVER, OK.  d06 both `31` exit 0;  node `31`, wasmtime `31`,
  kernel `31`, each exit 0;  d10 both `kanon: run: trap on both hosts`
  exit 4;  d10 kernel `kanon: run: kernel trap: 1073741824 is outside
  the i31 range` exit 4;  a10 with `--export start`
  `kanon: emit: unbound: axiom zero has no body` exit 2;  n01
  `mismatch: the term has type Type 2 and the expected type is Type 1`
  exit 1;  `run`, `run FILE`, `run FILE --export main --host jvm` each
  printed the usage line and exit 64;  `run ROOT/nosuch.kan --export
  main` printed `kanon: run: cannot read /Users/oobi/Documents/kanon/
  nosuch.kan` and the usage line, exit 64;  `emit` of d06 exit 0 and
  `check --erased` of c02 diffed empty against
  test/golden/c02-zero-binder.erased, so SD-G12 is unchanged.
- SE-G5 SPINE, OK.  `wc -l` is 348, `rg -c 'axiom'` prints nothing with
  rg exit 1, each of the twenty four patterns of brief 4 has at least
  one hit, and `--host kernel` printed `521`, the N of the promise line
  `-- main is 521`.
- SE-G6 HOSTS, OK.  The fourteen value fixtures printed 17, 10, 26, 10,
  78, 31, 25, 7, 232, 5, 1, 1, 11, 36 under `--host both`, `--host
  node` and `--host wasmtime`, every exit 0.  d10 exits 4 on all three
  shapes.  d11 states its answer in a sentence, not a `main is` line,
  and printed 5.
- SE-G7 PIN, OK.  The PIN file, `git -C vendor/tot rev-parse --short
  HEAD` and `git -C /Users/oobi/Documents/kan-lang-tot-pin rev-parse
  --short HEAD` all print `8cf0b8b`;  the pin porcelain is 0 lines.
- SE-G8 REPO, OK.  `rev-list --count HEAD` is 5, `log -1 --format=%s`
  is `M0 Stage D: WasmGC emission`, `diff --cached --stat` is empty and
  the porcelain holds only Stage E paths: ` M README.md`,
  ` M bin/kanon.ml`, `?? bin/host.ml`, `?? dev/gates.sh`,
  `?? dev/r0-audit.sh`, `?? dev/run-wasmtime.sh`,
  `?? dev/trusted-lines.sh`, `?? examples/`, and the two logs once this
  entry lands.  Nothing under _build or .gatework.
- SE-G9 TRUSTED-LINES, OK.  `zsh dev/trusted-lines.sh` printed
  `TRUSTED-LINES kernel=2305/3000 encoder=216/600 OK`, exit 0.
- SE-G10 HOUSE, OK.  `zsh dev/house.sh` printed `HOUSE no-exception OK`,
  `HOUSE no-mutable-state OK`, `HOUSE one-catch-site OK` with the one
  line `/Users/oobi/Documents/kanon/test/sys_io.ml:19:  try Ok (thunk
  ()) with Sys_error m -> Error m`, `HOUSE no-bool-match OK`,
  `HOUSE no-em-dash OK` and `HOUSE OK`, exit 0.  bin/host.ml holds no
  try, raise, bare wildcard arm, bool match, `.( )`, List.nth, ref or
  mutable (rg exit 1 on the union pattern).
- SE-G11 TIME, OK.  The SE-G2 run printed
  `PASS M0-TIME median_ms=122.859 bound_ms=150`, three decimals and at
  most 150, and `MEASURE M0-RATIO kanon_ms=29.916 tot_ms=103.662
  ratio=0.289` with a three decimal ratio.
- SE-G12 LOGS, OK.  This file holds `## Stage E (2026-09-05)` once,
  dev/MUTATION-LOG.md holds `## Stage E` once with SE-M1 to SE-M3, and
  `git -C ROOT diff -- dev/M0-BUILD-LOG.md dev/MUTATION-LOG.md` shows
  additions only.

### MEASURE table (the closing entry of plan section 12)

Verbatim from the judge's SE-G2 run of `zsh dev/gates.sh` on
2026-09-05 at 22:01, load average 14.21 (the machine carries the user's
desktop load).

The BUILD row is short because SE-G1 built the tree one minute before
the battery, so the BUILD leg had nothing to do.  The two timed legs
carry their own BENCH lines: `BENCH m0_e2e median_ms=122.859
min_ms=116.932 max_ms=132.079 runs=5` and `BENCH m0_ratio
median_ms=29.916 min_ms=29.227 max_ms=32.919 runs=5`.  M0-TIME is
122.859 ms against the ratified bound of 150 ms.  M0-RATIO is 0.289 and
stays informational at M0 (plan correction C2).

### Decisions

Brief pinned, SE-D1 to SE-D12.

- SE-D1 `--host` gains the word `kernel` beside node, wasmtime and both,
  and an omitted `--host` means both.  The user rules whether the extra
  word stays.
- SE-D2 The driver finds the two runners at the root above
  `Sys.executable_name`;  a moved binary exits 64 naming the runner.
  SE-D14 corrects the number of steps.
- SE-D3 The run path writes its module to `Filename.temp_file`, so an
  unwritable temp directory is loud and never a wrong answer.
- SE-D4 Exit 4 is a trap on one host, a trap on both hosts, or a kernel
  value outside the i31 range.  The user rules.
- SE-D5 The plan's first Stage E mutation splits in two: SE-M1 moves the
  module and SE-M2 makes one host lie.  Both must fail M0-E2E.
- SE-D6 gate_timed measures with zsh EPOCHREALTIME in milliseconds and
  the two timed legs use bench.sh's median, because bench.sh discards
  the output that carries a leg's verdict.  The user rules.
- SE-D7 gates.sh runs every leg after BUILD even when one fails, and
  prints every FAIL before GATES-FAIL.
- SE-D8 HOUSE and PIN join the battery as legs fourteen and fifteen;
  REPO does not, because the battery runs on a dirty tree.
- SE-D9 The M0-TIME command is `kanon run examples/m0-spine.kan --export
  main --host both`;  wasm-opt validation stays outside the timing.
- SE-D10 The M0-RATIO corpus is `test/main.exe ROOT/test`, the same
  command as tot's denominator.  The ratio is informational at M0.
- SE-D11 The spine has no axiom, so the AXIOMS leg's second half prints
  nothing;  b08 witnesses the axiom row in the first half.
- SE-D12 lib/, surface/ and wasm/ are frozen at Stage E except a bug the
  spine exposes.  SE-D33 records that no such bug appeared.

Builder decisions, SE-D13 to SE-D33.

- SE-D13 `Host.run_module` carries `~globals`, which the brief's
  signature leaves out, because the kernel host reduces a term instead
  of reading a file;  the two module hosts ignore it.
- SE-D14 The root is four `Filename.dirname` steps above
  `Sys.executable_name`, not the three the brief names:  kanon.exe, bin,
  default, _build.  Measured on the rsync copy, whose own
  dev/run-wasmtime.sh answered.
- SE-D15 The host drops the runner's own `trap: ` or `invalid: ` word
  from the first stderr line, so the driver prints
  `kanon: run: node trap: TEXT` once.
- SE-D16 The host word is read in the argument shape itself, one
  dispatch pattern per word, so no exit sits behind an eager
  `Option.fold ~none`;  an unknown word falls to the usage arm.
- SE-D17 A missing FILE under run prints `kanon: run: cannot read PATH`
  and then the usage line, exit 64.
- SE-D18 The kernel host reduces the exported name, not the literal
  `main`, so `--export NAME` means the same on all three hosts.
- SE-D19 The two capture files are the module path plus `.out` and
  `.err`, and they leave with the module.
- SE-D20 dev/run-wasmtime.sh names the exit code `code`, because
  `status` is read only in zsh.
- SE-D21 README lines 24 to 27 lost "the command that a later stage
  brings, run", and the status line now reads Stage E, because the run
  command made both sentences false.
- SE-D22 The spine omits auto, mu and nu, which SPEC section 9 lists,
  because check.ml:170 answers auto with `Not_yet` (rules.ml:24
  "instances arrive at M2") and parser.ml:299-300 refuses mu and nu.
  The header comment of the spine records the omission.
- SE-D23 gate_timed takes the tier by name, reads the seconds through
  `${(P)tier}` and prints tier=FAST, MED, SLOW or SUITE, which keeps
  every watchdog literal on the four tier lines.
- SE-D24 A leg whose body is more than one command lives in a shell
  function and the battery reaches it as `zsh dev/gates.sh --leg NAME`,
  because the watchdog is an external program.  The six such legs are
  axioms, e2e, time, ratio, denominators and pin.
- SE-D25 The leg wrapper takes an oracle or the word SELF.  SELF means
  the leg prints its own verdict line, because that line carries a
  value, and a SELF leg that the watchdog kills still gets a FAIL line.
- SE-D26 The PIN leg reads the pin worktree at
  /Users/oobi/Documents/kan-lang-tot-pin, which KANON_PIN_WORKTREE
  overrides, and every git call carries `--no-optional-locks`, so a read
  never writes an index into a read only worktree.
- SE-D27 BUILD runs at tier SLOW, because a battery on a fresh copy
  builds the whole tree and a tier is a hang ceiling, not a budget.
- SE-D28 The M0-E2E leg reads the spine's value from the promise line
  with `rg -N -o -- '-- main is [0-9]+'` and awk field 4, so the gate
  has no literal to drift from.
- SE-D29 The M0-E2E work directory .gatework/gates/e2e is removed and
  remade at the start of the leg, so a stale module can never answer.
- SE-D30 SE-G6 reads d11-poly-pair.kan's promise from its sentence, "The
  kernel and wasm must both return 5", because that fixture writes no
  `main is N` line.  The other fourteen carry the line.
- SE-D31 README gained The spine after Running a module and Gates after
  Build and test, two more Layout rows and three more Build and test
  rows, because those files became commands at Stage E.
- SE-D32 SE-M1 mutates the copy's wasm/emit.ml entry_func at line 717,
  the SD-D8 export wrapper, by appending `G.I32_const 1` and `G.I32_add`
  after `G.I31_get_s`.  The plan allows the source edit or a one byte
  edit of the module;  the source edit is reproducible and leaves the
  kernel untouched.
- SE-D33 No defect in a builder 1 file, in lib/, in surface/ or in wasm/
  was exposed by the spine or by any gate, so SE-D12 was never invoked
  and no golden moved.

### Findings

- F1, high at the time it was written, resolved as environmental.  The
  verifier saw `FAIL M0-TIME median_ms=161.421 bound_ms=150` and
  `FAIL M0-TIME median_ms=191.155 bound_ms=150` on two honest reruns and
  raised blockers SE-B5 and SE-B6.  The main loop then benched the same
  command on the same binary three times at load average 12 and read
  medians 142.441, 119.594 and 116.089 ms, all under 150;  another
  build's node driver held 107 percent CPU during the two red runs.  The
  judge's own run at load average 14.21 read 122.859 ms and the whole
  battery printed GATES-OK.  No code changed and the bound stays 150.
  The user's desktop load is the variable, not the run path.
- F2, low, informational.  dev/house.sh leg 1 refuses a wildcard arm
  through the pattern `\| _ ->`, a bare underscore between the pipe and
  the arrow, so a named catch-all does not match it.  bin/host.ml:89
  (`| _other ->`) and bin/kanon.ml:282 (`| _unknown ->`) hold such arms
  on open types, int and string, which no literal pattern can exhaust,
  so both are load bearing and correct today.  The gate offers no cover
  against a future misuse of the same idiom.  The verifier also cited
  bin/kanon.ml:89;  that line is an `~error` continuation of emit, not a
  match arm.  No change is asked at M0.
- F3, low, for the user.  The spine holds every production of SPEC
  section 9 except axiom, auto, mu and nu.  Brief 3.4 asks for every
  production except axiom, so this is a deviation that the front end
  forces:  check.ml:170 answers auto with `Not_yet`, parser.ml:299
  refuses mu with "mu arrives at M1" and parser.ml:300 refuses nu with
  "nu arrives at M2".  A spine that held one of the three could not
  check.  SE-D22 records it.  The user rules whether SPEC section 9
  should mark the three as post M0 forms.

### M0-EXIT checklist

Plan section 12's criteria, one line each.

- Stage 0 artifacts present and DENOMINATORS green.  MET.  The
  DENOMINATORS leg printed `denominators.json: OK` and `PASS
  DENOMINATORS` in the SE-G2 run.
- Stages A to E committed by the user with the printed lines.  OPEN.
  The repository holds 5 commits and HEAD is `M0 Stage D: WasmGC
  emission`;  Stage E is written and gated but not committed, because no
  agent commits.  The user runs `git -C ~/Documents/kanon add -A` and
  `git -C ~/Documents/kanon commit -m 'M0 Stage E: driver and gates'`.
- Every leg of section 9 green on the committed tree.  OPEN until that
  commit.  Every leg is green on the working tree:  fifteen PASS lines
  and `GATES-OK`, exit 0.
- dev/M0-BUILD-LOG.md holds the MEASURE table with M0-TIME at or under
  150 ms and the M0-RATIO line.  MET by this entry:  122.859 ms and
  `MEASURE M0-RATIO kanon_ms=29.916 tot_ms=103.662 ratio=0.289`.
- dev/MUTATION-LOG.md holds every mutation row of section 10 with its
  caught leg.  MET.  The Stage E section adds SE-M1, SE-M2 and SE-M3,
  each with its killing line.
- D-M0-1 to D-M0-6 ruled.  MET.  The user ruled all six as recommended
  on 2026-09-05.
- Open for the user before the stamp:  SE-D1 (the kernel host word),
  SE-D4 (exit 4 for a trap), SE-D6 (the two timers), and the builder
  decisions that touch the plan or this brief, SE-D13, SE-D14, SE-D17,
  SE-D22, SE-D23, SE-D24, SE-D25 and SE-D27.  The Stage D rulings
  SD-D1 to SD-D40 are still open as well.

M0-EXIT RATIFY: 2026-09-06 ratified (the user writes the date and
"ratified" here;  nothing else counts).

### Hand-off notes for M1

- SMu.  The shape sum declares SMu and SNu and rules.ml refuses both
  with `Not_yet`;  parser.ml:299 refuses the surface `mu` with "mu
  arrives at M1".  M1 opens the mu arm, the spine gains its production
  and F3 closes.
- The fibered Elim.  M0 cases a sum by tag with an `as x return T`
  motive.  M1 needs the fibered eliminator over an inductive family, so
  the branch key of D-M0-3, ALeg 0 with a two binder leg, becomes the
  general leg shape.
- Structural recursion.  M0 has tail calls through a global and no
  recursion checker beyond totality's 139 lines.  M1 adds the
  structural order and the guard that mu needs.
- M0-RATIO becomes binding at M1 (plan correction C2).  The M0 reading
  is 0.289 against tot's warm `test/main.exe` median of 103.662 ms, so
  there is headroom of about three times before the 2x bound bites.
- Open rulings that travel to M1:  SD-D1 to SD-D40 from Stage D, and
  SE-D1, SE-D4 and SE-D6 from this stage.
- The timing environment.  M0-TIME reads between 116 and 143 ms on a
  quiet machine and above 150 ms when another build holds a core, so M1
  should either bench on an idle machine or make the leg take the
  median of medians.  No agent may move the bound.

## Lanyard M0 Stage B (2026-09-09)

Base: Lanyard `52eb5a7`, the committed Stage A fork. The earlier sections
of this file are inherited Kanon history. User instruction for this slice:
"Continue building lanyard. Stage all changes." No commit was made.

Implemented the target layer from lanyard-m0/M0-PLAN.md section 5:
two `.sig` files, independent library identity tuples in `target/PIN.json`,
the four frozen S3 anchors in `target/pin.sha256`, deterministic generation
through `dev/gen-target.py` and `target/dune`, and the PIN/ANCHOR/DIFF gate.
There are 15 PROPOSED rows, including all nine foreign type constants.
Six Topcoat roadmap rows remain comments and generate no constants.

The stage command is `zsh dev/gates.sh --stage B`. It adds a stage selector
without changing the carried no-argument battery. A separate OCaml client
links the generated library and checks schema metadata and total lookup.
`test/dune` retains all existing support modules through `:standard` while
excluding the new client from the old test executables.

Validation on the final source:

- Build: 0 errors, 0 warnings.
- TARGET-SIG: 15 rows, nine foreign type constants, 104 generated lines.
- TARGET-PIN: PIN, ANCHOR and DIFF passed for two libraries and four sites.
- Mutation and regression suite: 27 tests passed, including one-byte
  changes at each of the four anchors and CLI failure without output damage.
- TARGET-CATALOG: the compiled OCaml consumer passed.
- KERNEL-CARRY: all 13 ledger rows and the twelve-file bucket passed.
- R0-COUNT: the carried eight-line census remains unchanged and passed.
- TRUSTED-LINES: kernel 3997/4000; generated signature 104 lines measured.
- Additional regression: `_build/default/test/main.exe test` completed
  with `SUITE-KERNEL OK`, including PARSE-OK 127/127 and NEG-OK 51/51.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- HOUSE: the five house-rule scans passed. `dev/stage-b.sh` line 16 runs them.

Captured output is under `dev/validation/stage-b/`. The build and stage
checks were run in a local clone of the same base before integration. The
capture `dev/validation/stage-b/gates.stdout` predates the HOUSE step. It
ends at `STAGE-B OK` on line 29 and holds no HOUSE row.

Decisions and next work:

- LSB-D1: JSON lines encode the five signature fields plus `kind` and
  `status`; no additional kernel term constructor is introduced. The
  generator validates structure, quantities, placeholder coverage and the
  foreign atom inventory. Kernel checking of instantiated schemas belongs
  to Stage C, as does the new census line and the full R0-TARGET gate.
- LSB-D2: the observed Topcoat release tag differs from the plan's
  "v0.7.0 plus one commit" statement. HEAD stays `51caa01`, crate version
  stays `0.6.2`, and the explicit `v0.7.0` tag peels to `8ef6d803`.
  The checkout is shallow and `git describe` reports `v0.6.2-9-g51caa01`.
  The gate checks the three independent identities, without asserting a
  tag distance. Full values and source references are in target/README.md.
- LSB-D3: A_sig is proposed at exactly 104 lines, the generated module's
  measured size. S0-D1 leaves this number to the user. The ruled total
  remains the formula `5481 + A_rir + A_emit + A_sig`; no total or allowance
  has been silently ratified.
- LSB-D4: the source templates are PROPOSED, with no claim of Rust
  compilation or fixture coverage. `Model.create` needs model-field
  instantiation; `Db.connect` needs the model inventory and a checked text
  representation. The carried checker refuses string literals, so Stage C
  must address that representation without extending the closed atom list.
  Type and model parameters are erased schema inputs, not unconstrained
  user-selectable foreign conversions.
- Stage C is next: signature and model elaboration, the census extension,
  and the first-order effect-response refusal. M0 emission and M0-EXIT
  remain future work. The user retains the numeric A_sig ruling and commit.
